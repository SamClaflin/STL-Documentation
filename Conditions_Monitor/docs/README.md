## Purpose
The purpose of the STL Conditions Monitor application is to replace the pre-existing STL Conditions Monitor application primarily of the purpose of allowing the website to be more securely hosted. Additionally, given that the rewrite of this application was done using more modern web technologies (detailed in the Architecture file), several design choices were made to increase the user experience, such as client-side graph rendering so that all data instances can be viewed in a single place without having to open multiple tabs and/or wait for the server to respond with HTML that corresponds with a different route of the website.
