## Documentation Structure
The entirety of the documentation of my ongoing projects at STL is presented in the following directory structure:
```bash
STL_Documentation/
|
|---Conditions_Monitor/
|	|---src/
|	|---docs/
|	|---notes/
|
|---Deep_Diver/
	|---src/
	|---docs/
	|---notes/
```
For each project, the source code is (unsurprisingly) contained within the `src` directory, the documentation is (also unsurprisingly) contained within the `docs` directory, and any notes I took throughout the course of building the project are contained within the `notes` directory.

## Markdown
All notes are written as Markdown files to provide additional aesthetic features when viewing in-browser (such as on GitHub) or using modern note taking apps that support Markdown rendering (such as Obsidian). I highly recommend viewing these notes using one of the aforementioned technologies for Markdown rendering for the best viewing experience.

## Contact
If, for any reason, you need to contact me with questions regarding any of the projects and their functionality, feel free to reach out at my student email.
