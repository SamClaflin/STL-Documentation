## Purpose
---
The purpose of the Deep Diver application is to rapidly identify either a single file or directory of files that could potentially be of an arbitrary file extension and contain unknown data. In addition to extracting this data and using it to construct actual instances of the respective file types that contain it, the Diver has several convenience features built into its UI that allow users to immediately preview this data and cycle between data instances without having to sift through the generated files manually (supports both text and image data).
